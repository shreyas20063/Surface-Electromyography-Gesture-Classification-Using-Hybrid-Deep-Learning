# Surface-Electromyography-Gesture-Classification-Using-Hybrid-Deep-Learning
This repository presents a hybrid deep learning approach for sEMG-based gesture classification. By combining CNNs, recurrent networks, and handcrafted features, the model classifies 5 hand gestures from 8-channel EMG signals, achieving 74.29% ± 3.15% accuracy with only 45,781 parameters.
